### Pathfinder 1st Edition
Disclaimer : I made modification to the core rules. As a GM you never really roll atk and def
for NPC. All atk and AC rolls for non-playable NPC are treated as a take 10. Instead players
will roll both atk and def with a /roll 1d20. The goal of this is to have the player roll as
much as possible and feel the have the random aspect in their hands. a Natural `1` on AC roll
from a player is treated as a `critical hit` from the attacking NPC while a `natural 20` is
treated as a `fumble` from the attacking NPC.

The character sheet is 95% identical to the source linked here
https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-character-sheets/blob/master/pathfinder_simple/pathfinder.html

Modifications done here are specific to our house rules and the players custom needs.
